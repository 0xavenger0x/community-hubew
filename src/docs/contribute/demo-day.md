## About Demo Day

Demo day was started by our amazing Ambassadors as a way for users to see all the cool dApps on Optimism! It runs every two weeks dApps have ~7 minutes to showcase their stuff. This can be anything from a full run through, to showing off a new feature, or promoting a special event on the dApp! 

For information about our next demo day, check out the [Demo-day channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/960493820674465883) in our Discord (it is under events). 

## Getting a Slot

Make sure you check all these boxes before applying for demoing, or you will not get a demo spot. These spots go fast! 

### Pre-demo check list

1. Is your dApp deployed & **live on Optimism**? Only dApp/features/etc that are ready to be use can be demo’d.
1. Are you and **your team in the Optimism Discord**? The call is on Discord, so best get everyone on there! Make sure to tag the team member(s) who are presenting in the demo day channel.
1. Do you have a **live or pre-recorded demo ready**? Your demo should be no longer than 7 minutes. Your demo can cover features, run throughs, promotions/special events etc. Just let us know!
1. Will you be **available for a test run the day before** the demo at the same time as the demo? Nothing sucks more than being ready to demo but your sound isn’t working... we do a very quick check that all your settings are correct!
1. If you have not presented in a Discord channel before, please watch this tutorial before your AV check. This makes everything faster! [Discord Basics: How To Setup Audio and Video Settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnMKZB6zTcQ)
