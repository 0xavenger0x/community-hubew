The NumbaNERDs program is designed to ensure that there is always high quality analytics and transparency around grant spending for delegates. 

As our governance grows clear and accessible data becomes ever more essential to good decision making. 

This program is currently going through governance, and as such is not live until it (hopefully) passes governance. 

You can follow the proposal [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-numbanerd-program/6086). 

There is also an [analytics focused channel in the Optimism Discord](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/928227180603899924) if you would like to get involved now!
