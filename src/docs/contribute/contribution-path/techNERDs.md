The TechNERDs program is designed to improve the technical support available to developers in the Optimism Ecosystem. 

This program is currently going through governance, and as such is not live until it (hopefully) passes governance. You can follow the proposal [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-technerd-program/6087). 

There are also a bunch of [developer focused channels in the Optimism Discord](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1080862392281481246) if you want to get involved now! There is also a telegram group!
