So you think you could make an impact in The Collective? We are so happy to have you! Let’s make sure we are on the same page about what The Collective is all about.

At the core of The Collective is the tenant “impact = profit”. This tenant aims to fix an injustice we see daily. Peoples impact on their community not being rewarded under capitalism. This flaw of the system haunts us in every aspect of modern day living. From infrastructure to third spaces, public goods are being cast aside and deprioritised, despite being essential. This problem is the thesis that Optimism is built around. What if we could fix how Public Goods get funded? 

“Impact = profit” is the optimistic solution. An experimental combination of capitalistic value capture with Collective sense making. A network of hardware that collects value combined with networks of humans to effectively distribute it. 

This is the vision of The Optimism Collective. Its big! Beautiful. Ambitious, and we need all the help we can get. This journey will be long and have many obstacles, lessons and evolutions before the fly wheel is established. 

So, how can you have the biggest impact in The Collective? We recommend following these 3 very easy principals:

1. ***Do what you love.*** → Real impact stems from passion, a love for what you do.
2. ***Fix the problem in front of you.*** → Chances are if you have a problem, someone else has that problem as well. Let’s fix it! What caused the problem? How do you fix it, and can you fix it for everyone else? 
3. ***Do it with optimism.*** → Be kind, patient and optimistic in everything you do. 

# WHERE TO GO
